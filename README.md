# Code for "Fair Ranking with Noisy Protected Attributes" 

This repository contains the code for reproducing the simulations in our paper "Fair Ranking with Noisy Protected Attributes."

## Running simulations
1. To reproduce the simulation on synthetic dataset run `Synthetic-data.ipynb`,
2. to reproduce the simulation on occupations-image dataset run `Occupations-data.ipynb`, and 
3. to reproduce the simulation on chess-ranking dataset run `Chess-ranking-data.ipynb`.

We provide copies of the chess-ranking dataset (by [Ghosh, Dutt, and Wilson](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3462850)) and the occupations-image dataset (by [Celis and Keswani](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3415210)) in the repository. 

This repository borrows code from the repositories [SIGIR_FairRanking_UncertainInference](https://github.com/evijit/SIGIR_FairRanking_UncertainInference) and [Noisy-Fair-Subset-Selection](https://github.com/AnayMehrotra/Noisy-Fair-Subset-Selection).
